/**
 * There are n houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and
 * laying pipes.
 * 
 * For each house i, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost wells[i - 1] (note the
 * -1 due to 0-indexing), or pipe in water from another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between
 * houses are given by the array pipes, where each pipes[j] = [house1, house2, cost] represents the
 * cost to connect house1 and house2 together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional.
 * 
 * Return the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, wells = [1,2,2], pipes = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1]] <br>
 * Output: 3 <br>
 * Explanation: The image shows the costs of connecting houses using pipes. The best strategy is to
 * build a well in the first house with cost 1 and connect the other houses to it with cost 2 so the
 * total cost is 3.
 * 
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/optimize-water-distribution-in-a-village/
 * 
 * Solution: Convert it into a standard minimum spanning tree (MST) problem and use Prim's
 * algorithm.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O((N+M)â‹…log(N+M)); Space Complexity: O(N+M)
